Script to recognise (czech) licence plates


KOZNA (KOntrola ZNAƒçek): A little web app made as a school project. 
Start by inputing a photo of your car with a licence plate visible,
the info (if availible) will be added to our database and shown

It only works with czech licence plates and our info might be a bit outdated,
because of the source of our information. Use this as a proof of concept
